    "After completing this project, you will be able to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Collect and save reddit data using the reddit API (through the ```praw``` library)\n",
    "- Be able to conduct descriptive analyses, via manipulation of data stored in a pandas dataframe, and via the creation and exploration of graphs, of the number of upvotes of reddit comments\n",
    "- Be able to conduct a linear regression to help understand the factors associated with a top post having many upvotes on reddit\n",
    "- **574 Only**: Be able to implement additional feature sets and/or a new model and describe why those decisions were made and what their effects were on performance\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Written Report (60 points)**: You will submit a PDF report that provides answers to questions here, and that contains plots we request.  These same questions are also posted in the assignment PDF, for convenience. **Again, the questions in the Assignment PDF and here are the same (for the written report), we just put them in both places for convenience.**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Saved file from Part 1.3 (10 points)**: See below for details. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Coding spot checks (30 points)** - We will select 6 problems to spot check. This means that we will check to make sure that your code is written in a reasonable way and that it obtains the desired results when we run your code. For example, your code should not be written in a way that makes it exceedingly slow, e.g. by using for loops where a vectorized approach would be applicable. We will *not* tell you which problems we are spot checking.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, you will submit, one member of your group will subit as a zip file on UBLearns, a ```.zip``` file that contains 3 things:\n",
    "- Your completed jupyter notebook.\n",
    "- Your written report, answering all questions asked here (and copied in the assignment PDF)\n",
